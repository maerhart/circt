    Deletes all functions in the module. In case there is still a function
    call in an entity or process, it fails.
    This pass is intended as a post-inlining pass to check if all functions
    could be successfully inlined and remove the inlined functions. This
    is necessary because Structural LLHD does not allow functions. Fails in
    the case that there is still a function call left in a `llhd.proc` or
    `llhd.entity`.

def EarlyCodeMotion : Pass<"llhd-early-code-motion", "llhd::ProcOp"> {

  let description = [{
    Moves side-effect-free instructions as far up in the CFG as possible. That
    means to the earliest block where all operands are defined. Special care has
    to be given to the `llhd.prb` instruction (which is the only side-effect
    instruction moved by this pass) as it must stay in the same temporal region,
    because otherwise it might sample an older or newer state of the signal.
    This pass is designed as a preparatory pass for the Temporal Code Motion
    pass to be able to move the `llhd.drv` operations in a single TR exiting
    block without having to move operations defining the operands used by the
    `llhd.drv`. It also enables total control flow elimination as the `llhd.prb`
    instructions would not be moved by other canonicalization passes.
